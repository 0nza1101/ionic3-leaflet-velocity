This is a sample application using Ionic 3 and Leaflet with leaflet-velocity.
Since it was a headache to implement leaflet-velocity with Ionic 3, I decided to share it.

 ## Get it running
 * Clone this repository: `https://github.com/0nza1101/leaflet-velocity-ionic.git`.
 * Run `npm install` from the project root.
 * If you do not install the ionic CLI (`npm install cordova ionic -g`)
 * Run `ionic serve` in a terminal from the project root.
